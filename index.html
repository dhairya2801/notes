        <ul class="ideas">
            <li>Tutorial generator from a template. Example; generate
                a tutorial to explain 3D reconstruction, in the style of 3B1B.
            </li>
            <li>An extension which lets me ask questions based on the video I 
                am watching on YT.
            </li>
            <li>
                Build a gpt2 level chatbot from scratch. Use 
                <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat">nanochat</a>
                as reference, but don't copy paste code from it.
            </li>
            <li>Natural language teaching for recommendation systems. For instance,
                I watched a reel on insta about Markov Chains, I found that
                interesting so I went to YT to learn more about it. I want to be 
                able to notify insta that that kind of reel made me leave the app to
                explore more on that topic. (I think they already do this but not
                sure if leaving the app might relate to being not interested in that
                topic.)
